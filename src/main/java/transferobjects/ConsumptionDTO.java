 * Purpose:
 * This class represents the Data Transfer Object (DTO) for the Consumption entity.
 * It encapsulates one record of actual vehicle energy/fuel consumption, along with
 * its associated distance and expected consumption rate from the vehicle table.
 * It is used to pass consumption-related data between the data access and business layers.
